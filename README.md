# Spoken-Language-Recognition-without-Audio
Spoken Language Recognition without Audio. It's my computer vision project for the exam, together with my colleague Rosaria Leone.
Our dataset consisted of 960 videos in the training set, 160 in the test set, and 160 in the validation set. The dataset contains videos in 8 languages: Italian, English, German, Spanish, Dutch, Russian, Japanese and French. Our goal was to use a recurrent neural network combined with the "Feature Level Fusion" technique to obtain a video classification.
